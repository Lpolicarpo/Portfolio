## Here you will find a sample of some of my work related to Data Science. 

### Below there is a short description of each file.  

- Machine Learning Project - Direct Mailing: This is a beginning to end ML Project with real data from a charitable organization. It was also used as the final project of the UofT ML course. 

- Fundraising Report - This is a report developed in my role as a volunteer for nonprofits. There are no statistical models but significant data engineering and visualizations involved. The goal is to show and discuss essential fundraising metrics.
