### Below there is a short description of each file.  

- Machine Learning Project - Direct Mailing: This is a beginning to end ML Project with real data from a charitable organization. It was also used as the final project of the UofT ML course. 

- Fundraising Report - This is a report developed in my role as a volunteer for nonprofits. There are no statistical models but significant data engineering and visualizations involved. The goal is to show and discuss essential fundraising metrics.

- Scientific Manuscript - This is a summary of my Master's Thesis. No codes, just academic writing and statistical analysis applied to Chemical Engineering.  

### Interesting codes developed during courses or personal interest:

Simplified version of models from scratch
- Decision Trees from scratch
- Multiple regression from scratch
- Logistic regression from scratch

Others
- Regularization techniques Analysis.
- Polynomial-regression exercise
